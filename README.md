# ProgLinear

Linear Programming (LP) is a powerful mathematical optimization technique used to find the best outcome in a mathematical model with linear relationships. Transportation problems, a specific class of LP, involve optimizing the distribution of goods from multiple sources to multiple destinations while minimizing costs.
Features:

This repository contains a C# implementation that addresses two transportation problems, made for my LP class ðŸ“š
This code is really raw, due the nature of the class (we had to show every algorithmic step to solve the problem)
Also this solution is not intended to be generic, but I hope it can help you for your class work ðŸ˜Š

# Getting Started:

To use this solver, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/NeroMohn/ProgLinear.git`

* Open the solution in your preferred C# IDE.

* Run the program.cs of the specific project that you are looking for.
