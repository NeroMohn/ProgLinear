# ProgLinear

Linear Programming (LP) is a powerful mathematical optimization technique used to find the best outcome in a mathematical model with linear relationships. Transportation problems, a specific class of LP, involve optimizing the distribution of goods from multiple sources to multiple destinations while minimizing costs.
Features:

This repository contains a C# implementation that addresses two transportation problems, made for my LP class ðŸ“š

# Getting Started:

To use this solver, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/NeroMohn/ProgLinear.git`

* Open the solution in your preferred C# IDE.

* Run the program.cs of the specific project that you are looking for.

This solution is not intended to be generic, but you can use it as a reference for your own problems ðŸ˜Š
